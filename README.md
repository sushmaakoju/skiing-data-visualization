# skiing-data-visualization

This was part of Information Visualization Course at University of Colorado Boulder.

Visualize Simulated Skiing data.

By using max speed per run per each day, I could visualize
with a skiing icon to represent the skierâ€™s max speed per day here.
Skier's speed maintained the pace for Feb 5th and Feb 12th days.
